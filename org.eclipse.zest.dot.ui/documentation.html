<p>Requirements: Eclipse 3.5 and GEF Zest visualization (Galileo),
org.eclipse.zest.import (dot4zest)</p>

<p><img src="resources/docs/dependencies.png"

<p>This bundle defines New-Wizards for Zest Graphs and Zest Projects
under a category labeled 'Visualization':</p>
<p><img src="resources/docs/wizard-screenshots/zest-wizards.png"></p>

<p>It also adds a Zest Graph view (see documentation at <a
	href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphviz_DOT_as_a_DSL_for_Zest">
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphviz_DOT_as_a_DSL_for_Zest</a>):</p>

<p><b>Graphviz DOT as a DSL for Zest - M4: Zest project type
with Graphviz support (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/277400">Bug
277400</a>)</b></p>

<p>Milestone 4 adds a Zest project nature, builder, and wizard. The
project created by the wizard contains a 'templates' folder containing a
sample DOT file. The DOT files in the 'templates' folder are compiled to
Zest graph subclasses by the builder, which can be launched as Java
applications to view the Zest Graph:</p>
<p><img
	src="resources/docs/wizard-screenshots/project/project-wizard-result.png"></p>

<p>Effectively this implements a basic Zest authoring environment
using DOT as a DSL, as upon saving the DOT file, the same Zest
application can be relaunched, showing the Zest graph created from the
changed DOT file.</p>

<p><b>Graphviz DOT as a DSL for Zest - M3: Zest wizard for
Graphviz import (<a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/277399">Bug 277399</a>)</b></p>

<p>Milestone 3 adds a New-Wizard called 'Zest Graph' under a
category labeled 'Visualization'. In the first page the container and a
graph template are selected, the resulting Zest graph for the template
is previewed:</p>
<p><img
	src="resources/docs/wizard-screenshots/graph/graph-wizard-page1.png"></p>

<p>In the second page the DOT representation of the selected
template can be customized:</p>
<p><img
	src="resources/docs/wizard-screenshots/graph/graph-wizard-page2.png"></p>

<p>After the wizard finishes, it tries to run the generated Zest
Graph to display the result (here customized in the second page):</p>
<p><img
	src="resources/docs/wizard-screenshots/graph/graph-wizard-result.png"></p>

<p>To have the generated file launch immediately, setup a project
that has all Zest bundles (including org.eclipse.zest.dot.export) on the
classpath and create the graph in the "org.eclipse.zest.dot" package (M4
provides a wizard for a fully configured Zest project, see above and the
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Graphviz_DOT_as_a_DSL_for_Zest">
dot4zest wiki page</a>).</p>
